Description: Calculate estimators and standard errors in a linear instrumental
    variables model with possibly many instruments and many exogenous regressors
    under homoskedasticity of the reduced form, using methods developed in
    Kolesár (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2018.01.004>. Also computes tests of
    overidentifying restrictions.
